### VARIANCE - The difference in fits between train and test datasets is called Variance.

The above diagram is **HIGH VARIANCE** - Great on Training | Bad on Testing Dataset </br>
An ideal ML Algo is suppose to follow **LOW VARIANCE** - Good on Training | Good on Testing Dataset </br>

The above diagram is **HIGH BIAS** - Bad on Training | Bad on Testing Dataset </br>
An ideal ML Algo is suppose to folloe **LOW BIAS** - Good on Training | Good on Testing Dataset </br>
